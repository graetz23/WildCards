# WildCards

A playing card simulator / library and software design pattern playing ground written in C#.

## Purpose
### Simulator
The simulator should play some playing card games, e.g. like poker, and generates statistical data. Implementation target is a threaded background process that is runable as daemon on a GNU/Linux system 24/7. 

### Design Patterns
For the implementation of the simulator, different design pattens are applied by adapting those towards C#. Those vary e.g. from Factory, Facade, Prototype, Strategy, and Observer pattern.

### Philosophy
The project supplies oneself as a *look-up* or a *how-to do it* in C# summary.

## Development
Mono and MonoDevelop by debian GNU/Linux is and was used for implementation.

## Remarks
I used this project to get from C++ into C# and also into mono and MonoDevelop.
